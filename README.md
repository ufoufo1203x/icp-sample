# ICP Sample Canister Deployment 

## üåç What is ICP?
The **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** is a blockchain network that enables smart contract execution at web speed, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) that run directly on the blockchain without centralized cloud providers. It is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient ecosystem for running Web3 applications.

## üèó What is a Canister?
A **Canister** is a computational unit on the ICP network, similar to a smart contract on other blockchains but with additional capabilities. Canisters contain both the backend (WebAssembly modules, often written in Rust or Motoko) and frontend assets, allowing them to serve web applications directly. They execute logic, store data, and interact with other canisters and users in a decentralized manner.

## üéØ Project Purpose
This project is a simple smart contract deployed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It demonstrates how to create and interact with a basic canister. It uses Rust to implement a `greet` function that returns "Hello, [name]!" when a name is provided. 

The frontend provides a simple web interface, allowing users to call the `greet` function directly.

## üîß Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to deploy the project locally or on the ICP mainnet.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install ICP SDK
First, set up the ICP development environment:
```sh
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ufoufo1203x/icp-sample.git
cd icp-sample
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Locally
Run the following commands to deploy the canister locally:
```sh
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to ICP Mainnet (Optional)
To deploy on the ICP network, run:
```sh
dfx deploy --network ic
```
**Note:** Deploying to the mainnet requires **Cycles (fees).**

## üîç Testing the Deployment
After deployment, verify the smart contract functionality.

### ‚úÖ 1. Test the Frontend
Open the following URL in your browser:
```
http://bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai.localhost:4943/
```
Ensure the DApp loads and users can call the `greet` function.

### ‚úÖ 2. Test the Backend (Smart Contract)
Open Candid UI and execute the `greet` function:
```
http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```
Or call the function via the terminal:
```sh
dfx canister call hello_backend greet "Name"
```
Expected Output:
```
("Hello, Name!")
```
